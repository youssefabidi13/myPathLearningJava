-Read 10 numbers from the console entered by the user and print the sum of those numbers.
-Create a Scanner like we did in the previous video.
-Use the hasNextInt() method from the scanner to check if the user has entered an int value.
-If hasNextInt() returns false, print the message gInvalid Numberh. Continue reading until you have read 10 numbers.
-Use the nextInt() method to get the number and add it to the sum.
-Before the user enters each number, print the message gEnter number #x:h where x represents the count, i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.
-For example, the first message printed to the user would be gEnter number #1:h, the next gEnter number #2: h, and so on.

Hint: 
-Use a while loop.
-Use a counter variable for counting valid numbers.
-Close the scanner after you donft need it anymore.
-Create a project with the name ReadingUserInputChallenge.
